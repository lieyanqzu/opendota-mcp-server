## Usage

### Setting up your environment

1. (Optional but recommended) Create an OpenDota API key at https://www.opendota.com/api-keys
2. Set your API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENDOTA_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Running the server directly

```bash
python -m src.opendota_server.server
```

### Running the server with Claude Desktop

Follow this: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user

If you use WSL, assuming you have cloned the repo and set up the python environment, this is how I wrote the claude_desktop_config.json:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "opendota": {
      "command": "wsl.exe",
      "args": [
        "--",
        "bash",
        "-c",
        "cd ~/opendota-mcp-server && source .venv/bin/activate && python src/opendota_server/server.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

```bash
python -m src.client
```
