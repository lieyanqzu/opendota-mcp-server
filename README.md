# OpenDota MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation for accessing OpenDota API data. This server enables LLMs and AI assistants to retrieve real-time Dota 2 statistics, match data, player information, and more through a standard interface.

## Features

- Access player profiles, statistics, and match history
- Retrieve detailed match information 
- Look up professional players and teams
- Get hero statistics and rankings
- Search for players by name
- And more!


## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/asusevski/opendota-mcp-server.git
cd opendota-mcp-server

# Install with uv and only uv (pip is for nerds)
uv add pyproject.toml

# For development dependencies
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Usage

### Setting up your environment

1. (Optional but recommended) Create an OpenDota API key at https://www.opendota.com/api-keys
2. Set your API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENDOTA_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Running the server directly

```bash
python -m src.opendota-server.server
```

### Running the server with Claude Desktop

Follow this: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user

If you use WSL, assuming you have cloned the repo and set up the python environment, this is how I wrote the claude_desktop_config.json:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "opendota": {
      "command": "wsl.exe",
      "args": [
        "--",
        "bash",
        "-c",
        "cd ~/opendota-mcp-server && source .venv/bin/activate && python src/opendota_server/server.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Using the example client

```bash
python -m src.client
```
